The ray transfer matrix is a mathematical tool that describes how a ray's height and angle change as it travels through an optical system, with different matrices representing translation (propagation through free space), refraction (bending of light at an interface), and focusing (using a lens or curved mirror). The matrices for each element are multiplied together to get a single matrix for the entire system, which can then be used to calculate the ray's final position and angle. 
Ray trajectory and matrix analysis Ray trajectory: A ray's path is defined by its height and its angle relative to the optical axis.Matrix representation: A ray's state is represented by a column vector \([height;angle]\). The change in the ray's state as it passes through an optical element is described by multiplying the ray vector by the element's ray transfer matrix (often called the ABCD matrix). 
Component-specific matrices Translation: For a ray traveling a distance \(d\) in a homogeneous medium, the matrix is \(\left(\begin{matrix}1&d\\ 0&1\end{matrix}\right)\).Refraction: For a flat surface between media with refractive indices \(n_{1}\) and \(n_{2}\), the matrix is \(\left(\begin{matrix}1&0\\ 0&n_{1}/n_{2}\end{matrix}\right)\). For a curved surface with radius of curvature \(R\), the matrix is \(\left(\begin{matrix}1&0\\ (n_{1}-n_{2})/(Rn_{2})&n_{1}/n_{2}\end{matrix}\right)\).Focusing:Thin lens: For a lens with focal length \(f\), the matrix is \(\left(\begin{matrix}1&0\\ -1/f&1\end{matrix}\right)\).Thick lens: The matrix is a product of matrices for the two refracting surfaces and the translation of the ray through the lens's thickness.Curved mirror: For a curved mirror with radius of curvature \(R_{e}\), the matrix is \(\left(\begin{matrix}1&0\\ -2/R_{e}&1\end{matrix}\right)\). 
Combining matrices To analyze a system with multiple components, you multiply the individual matrices in order. The overall transfer matrix of the system is the product of the matrices for each component.For example, the matrix for a system consisting of a free-space translation followed by a thin lens is:\(M_{total}=M_{lens}\times M_{translation}=\left(\begin{matrix}1&0\\ -1/f&1\end{matrix}\right)\left(\begin{matrix}1&d\\ 0&1\end{matrix}\right)=\left(\begin{matrix}1&d\\ -1/f&1-d/f\end{matrix}\right)\).
